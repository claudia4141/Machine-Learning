# Machine-Learning
In each of the problem sets, I explore the following topics in machine learning:<br />
Pset2: Bias, Variance, Cross-Validation<br />
Pset3 : Hyperparameter Search, Feature Engineering, and Feature Selection<br />
Pset4: Support Vector Machines<br />
Pset5: Training a logistic classifier
